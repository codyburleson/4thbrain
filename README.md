# Obsidian 4th Brain Plugin

## Vision

The Obsidian 4th Brain plugin aims to create harmony between human cognition, digital note-taking, community wisdom, and artificial intelligence. This plugin will extend Obsidian's capabilities by integrating these four types of intelligence into a cohesive knowledge management ecosystem.

Rather than competing with existing tools or forcing users to choose between different approaches, 4th Brain seeks to create synergy between different types of intelligence: your brain, your digital notes, community knowledge, and AI assistance.

## Planned Features

- **Multi-Channel Publishing:** Seamlessly publish Obsidian notes to various platforms (Medium, Substack, etc.) with smart format adaptation
- **Community Integration:** Share and discover PKM patterns and mental models within the community
- **AI Augmentation:** Leverage AI agents that understand PKM standards and help maintain knowledge base consistency
- **Self-Hosted Publishing:** Alternative to Obsidian Publish with unique customization options

## Development Status

This project is in its early stages of development. We are committed to building in public and welcome community involvement from the start. Current focus areas:

- Setting up the self-hosted publishing platform (based on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/))
- Building the foundational plugin architecture
- Establishing community standards framework
- Designing the agent system architecture

## Why Open Source from Day One?

We believe in transparency and community-driven development. By making this repository public from the beginning, we aim to:

- Share our development journey
- Gather early feedback and ideas
- Build a community of contributors
- Establish open standards for PKM together

## Community Standards

This plugin will adhere to and help establish PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) standards. 
We believe in creating open standards that can drive tool integration and AI augmentation in the knowledge management space.
